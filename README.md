# OOP_BooleanNetwork_Abundances_microRNA
This is a collection of Python files providing objects representing behavior of Boolean networks, helper methods, and visualization methods (matplotlib, text). Additionally, objects provided have representation of abundances (RNA sequences) and microRNA (effecting rates of RNA degradation, TODO: translation, and transcription).
