# OOP_BooleanNetwork_Abundances_microRNA
This is a collection of Python files providing objects representing behavior of Boolean networks, helper methods, and visualization methods (matplotlib, text). Additionally, objects provided have representation of abundances (RNA sequences) and microRNA (effecting rates of RNA degradation, TODO: translation, and transcription).

### TODO:

Revise variable names

Implement hash table based lookups where applicable

Rename and clean up plotting functions

Make Examples ipynb displaying all plotting functions output and example usage
