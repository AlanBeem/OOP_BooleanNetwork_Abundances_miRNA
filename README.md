# OOP_BooleanNetwork_Abundances_microRNA
This is a collection of Python files providing objects representing behavior of Boolean networks, helper methods, and visualization methods (matplotlib, text). Additionally, objects provided have representation of abundances (RNA sequences) and microRNA (effecting rates of RNA degradation, TODO: translation, and transcription).

### TODO:

Add default keyword arguments where applicable

Implement functionality wrt K st criticality can be specified

Write an efficient numpy version with the same data visualization capabilities

Revise variable names

Implement hash table based lookups where applicable

Rename and clean up plotting functions (some progress re Examples, still more to do)

Convert representation of sequences to binary encoding: A:00, U/T:11, G:01, C:10
