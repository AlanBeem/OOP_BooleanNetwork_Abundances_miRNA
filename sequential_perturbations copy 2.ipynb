    "### Conceptual background, introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perturbed Boolean networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let Boolean network functions, input assignments be immutable; Each sequence of unit perturbations is fired probabilistically (a la Petri-net);\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a Gene Regulatory Network whose edges are derived from correlations of differentially expressed genes, from measurements of abundances of protein, RNA over a panel of perturbations or natural variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "How different would such GRNs really be for unperturbed, and perturbed networks? In terms of design-space of perturbations / interventions, the result of weighing edges is likely not sufficiently unique to specify a cassette, further, it would not (TBD) pose a subset of subproblems (???)\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of backtracking, a condition could be applied to the as-would-be-inferred GRN, such that ??? maybe we can expect that healthy cellular systems, with such an altered GRN, woudl still behave healthily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a sequence of unit perturbations (p1, p2) such that for all cycles (except goal cycle) there exists an interval L such that a run-in from the perturbed state (i.e. p1 has been applied, L steps have occurred, and p2 has been applied) would terminate in cycle detection of the goal cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Perturbation does not fire in goal states. (This can be relaxed, but I'm not sure it would work, practically, this could be embodied by a constitutive or conditional payload in the perturbation that fires only in the goal state, causing cell death)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implication:\n",
    "\n",
    "If such a sequential perturbation exists, then, where it is applied probabilistically to a distribution of network states, eventually, all trajectories will be in goal states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Applications of a similar search, for scaled and meaningfully assigned Boolean networks, includes designed changes to cancer ecosystems."
